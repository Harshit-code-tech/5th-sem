Question: Implement a UDP server in C that listens for messages from clients. When a message is received, the server should respond with the length of the message. The client should send a message to the server and print the length of the message received in the response.
Requirements:
The client should send a message to the server on a specific port.
The server should listen on the same port for incoming messages.
The server should respond with the length of the received message.
The client should print the length of the message received from the server.
Hints:
Use sendto and recvfrom functions for communication.
Use the strlen function to calculate the length of the message.
Ensure the client and server use the same port number for communication.
Display the messages and lengths sent and received on the console.
